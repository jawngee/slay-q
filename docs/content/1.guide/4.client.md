# SlayQ Client

## Creating the Client
In order to dispatch or receive events in whatever stack you are working with, you'll need to create a client.  Here's an example:

```js
import { SlayQClient } from "@slay-pics/slay-q";
import { SlayQSupabaseDriver } from "@slay-pics/slay-q-supabase";

import { sleepTestEvent, type SleepTestEvent } from "~/server/slay-q/testing/sleep-test";
import { cronTestEvent, type CronTestEvent } from "~/server/slay-q/testing/cron-test";
import { cancelOnTest, type CancelOnTestEvent } from "~/server/slay-q/testing/cancel-on-test";

export type TestingEvents = {
  "testing/sleep-test": z.infer<typeof SleepTestEvent>;
  "testing/cron-test": z.infer<typeof CronTestEvent>;
  "testing/cancel-on-test": z.infer<typeof CancelOnTestEvent>;
};

export const TestingFunctions = [
  sleepTestEvent,
  cronTestEvent,
  cancelOnTest,
];

export const defaultSlayQClient = new SlayQClient<TestingEvents>({
  driver: new SlayQSupabaseDriver(),
  endpoint: "http://localhost/api/slay-q",
  functions: [
    ...TestingFunctions,
  ],
});
```
There's a bit to unpack here.

First we are creating a `TestingEvents` type that maps an event to the event's data type (inferred from the event's data's schema).
This type is then passed to the SlayQClient so that any calls to `sendEvent` are typed.

Second thing we are doing is creating a `const` called `Testing Functions` that is just an array of all of our testing functions.  It
seems silly to do it for just 3 functions, but when this gets larger and you're pulling in functions for different parts of your app,
you'll want to keep this as organized and neat as possible.  We have 180+ functions in use on Slay.

The `endpoint` is where `slay-q-server` can callback to when it has an event for your app to process.  Obviously this should be
specified with configuration or environment variables.

The `driver` is the interface with the database that the client will use.  Slay Q provides three base packages with different drivers:

* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-supabase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-supabase) - Supabase driver that uses `@supabase/supabase-js` to connect to supabase.
* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-postgres) - Driver that talks directly to Postgres via `pg` package.
* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-rpc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-rpc) - Driver that talks to a [`slay-q-ingest`](https://bitbucket.org/slay-pics/slay-utils/src/main/apps/slay-q-ingest/) instance.  The Slay Q ingest is an HTTP RPC server.  See the nuxt example app for an example of its use.


## Dispatch Events
Once you've created the client, dispatching events is easy:

```js
await defaultSlayQClient.sendEvent("products/video-product/unlocked", {
  videoProductId: videoProduct.id,
  profileId: profile.id,
  userId: profile.user_id,
});
```
In this example, we're dispatching an unlocked event for a video product with the associated data needed for the event.

## Receiving Events
This is where it will get trickier because this part is dependent entirely on whatever stack or backend you are using.  For us,
that is [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

We create a nitrojs handler at `/api/slay-q/index.post.ts` that looks like:

```js
import { useValidatedBody } from "h3-zod";
import { createError, H3Event, sendError } from "h3";
import { SlayQReceiveEventPayloadSchema } from "@slay-pics/slay-q";
import { defaultSlayQClient } from "~/lib/slay-q/default-slay-q-client";

export default defineEventHandler(async event => {
  const sig = getHeader(event, "X-SlayQ-Signature");
  if (!sig) {
    sendError(event, createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: 'Invalid signature' }));
    return;
  }

  const body = await useValidatedBody(event, SlayQReceiveEventPayloadSchema);

  await defaultSlayQClient.receiveEvent(sig, body);

  return {
    status: "ok",
  };
});
```
First we get the `X-SlayQ-Signature` header which contains the signature of the request.  Note that you will need to have the
environment variable `SLAY_Q_WORKER_SECRET` defined in your `.env` or wherever you are specifying environment variables.

We then fetch the body of the request (as a parsed JSON object) with `useValidatedBody`.  We've passed in the
`SlayQReceiveEventPayloadSchema` schema to validate the payload against.

We then call the `receiveEvent` method on the SlayQClient instance which handles the rest.

This should be pretty easy to adapt other frameworks.
