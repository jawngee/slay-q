# How It Works
Put in the most simple terms: at certain points in your application something will happen that triggers an event you want to 
process in the background, for example a file upload.  When this happens, your app saves the event to your supabase/postgres 
database.  The SlayQ server picks up the event and sends it to your application for processing.

Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the general gist.  You have control over concurrency and can create
multi-step background tasks that have very complicated workflows.  You can schedule these events to run well in the future or you
can create jobs that run on a schedule.

SlayQ is broken into two components: the SlayQ client and the SlayQ server.  There is an optional third component called the SlayQ
Ingest server which acts as an HTTP RPC interface to the server components.  At a minimum though, you'll need to include the client
in your application and run the server elsewhere.
