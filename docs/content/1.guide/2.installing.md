# Using In Your App


## Installing Into Your App

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @slaypics/slay-q
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install @slaypics/slay-q
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install @slaypics/slay-q
```

::

Additionally, you'll need to select a driver package to connect to your database:

* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-supabase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-supabase) - Supabase driver that uses `@supabase/supabase-js` to connect to supabase.
* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-postgres) - Driver that talks directly to Postgres via `pg` package.
* [`@slay-pics/slay-q-rpc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slay-pics/slay-q-rpc) - Driver that talks to a [`slay-q-ingest`](https://bitbucket.org/slay-pics/slay-utils/src/main/apps/slay-q-ingest/) instance.  The Slay Q ingest is an HTTP RPC server.  See the nuxt example app for an example of its use.

If the bulk of your app is using `supabase-js` to access Supabase then choose the Supabase driver.  Otherwise, if you are using
something like `pg`, `drizzle` or `knex` then use the Postgres driver.

If you'd like to futureproof your app a little, using the RPC driver but know that you'll have to deploy the RPC Ingest Server
alongside the SlayQ server.  It deploys easily on Vercel and other serverless providers.

### Environment Variables
You can configure the driver by passing in options to the constructor, or alternatively you can specify the following environment variables,

For the supabase driver:

* `SUPABASE_URL` - URL to your supabase instance
* `SUPABASE-SERVICE-KEY` - Service key for your supabase instance

For the postgres driver:

* `DATABASE_URL` - The database connection string url

For the Ingest RPC driver:

* `SLAY_Q_WORKER_SECRET` - Shared secret used to validate RPC requests
* `SLAY_Q_INGEST_ENDPOINT` - URL to the slay-q ingest endpoint

## Running the Dev Server
To get started quickly, you can run the dev server locally:

::code-group

```bash [shell]
npx giget@latest giget@latest bitbucket:slay-pics/slay-utils/docker slayq-docker
cd slayq-docker
docker compose up -d
```
::

This will launch three containers: a postgres instance, the Slay Ingest RPC server and the SlayQ server.  You should configure
your client ([read more](/guide/server)) with the RPC driver using the following environment variables and values:

::code-group
```bash [.env]
SLAY_Q_WORKER_SECRET=G,4DgB$.?>X]"w}w1745Xq2nKoM4BG74
SLAY_Q_INGEST_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3012
```

::


## Next Steps
Once you've installed the packages and have the dev server running:

* [Write some functions](/guide/functions)
* [Configure the client](/guide/client)
